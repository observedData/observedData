## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a second-year medical student at UNECOM, an osteopathic medical school based in Portland, ME. I am interested in reproductive epidemiology and Bayesian analysis. Here you can find projects and companion code for published papers. I am currently learning about causal inference and look forward to conducting causal inference research in the future.
